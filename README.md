# MP_Pose
Test MP_Pose tflite on Android Studio.  

I was training openpose model to creat the ckpt weight and convert the tflite file from tensorflow_Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation (https://github.com/michalfaber/tensorflow_Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation)
and this project is to practice testing tflite file to deploy on Android Studio.  
It's not yet to done.
